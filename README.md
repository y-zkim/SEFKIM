## What's SEFKIM ?

SEFKIM is a mobile application that I designed as part of the mini project for the Android Development module. The name of the application comes from a combination of my name and surname (YOUSSEF ZKIM).

SEFKIM is an innovative Android application that I designed to allow you to discover and use exceptional images from Flickr. It uses the Flickr API to retrieve images from different categories and offers you a smooth and enjoyable navigation experience.

## What can you do with it ? 

The application allows you to search for images using keywords or tags, allowing you to quickly find the images you are looking for. You can also browse images according to different categories, such as fashion, sports, technology, etc.

One of the key features of SEFKIM is the ability to add images to your favorites. This allows you to save the images you like and easily find them later. You can also download the images to the internal storage of your phone for offline use.

SEFKIM also offers you the ability to customize the appearance of the application by choosing between a dark or light theme. The application also remembers your theme choice so you don't have to select it again when you use it.

In summary, SEFKIM is an easy-to-use Android application that offers great flexibility and advanced features to allow you to discover and use amazing images from Flickr. It is ideal for photographers, artists, bloggers, and anyone looking to use high-quality images for their creative projects.
